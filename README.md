# Online-Book-Repository
The main objective of the project is to create an online book store that allows users to find
and purchase a book online based on title, writer and book id. The user can order their
required book by filling up an order form and they have to pay through Mobile banking
services (bKash, Nagad, Rocket, and Upay). Using this Website the user can purchase a
book online instead of going out to a book store and wasting time. There are many online
book stores like Powellâ€Ÿs, Amazon which were designed using Html. We want to develop
a similar website using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL .If the admin want to add more books
in the store then they have to sign up first by entering their name, mail and password .If
they are already a member then they have to only log in by entering their name and
password. The Administrator will have additional functionalities when compared to the
common user. The admin can add, delete and update the book details.


# Objectives
Our objective is to design such an application using which one can say 'goodbye' to the
days when you stood in line waiting and waiting some more for a store clerk to finally
check out your items. Online shopping transactions occur instantly-saving your time to get
your other errands done. Additionally, unlike a store, online shopping has friendly
customer service representatives available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to assist you with
locating, purchasing, and shipping your merchandise. Our main aim is to design such a book
store where customers can visit our site any time of the day from anywhere to view
the available books, choose any of them, and can order and pay through Mobile banking
services. The administrator will regularly add any new books available to them for sale.
The administrator will take books from reputed publishers and vendors only.

# Future scope:
Software development is never never-ending process and continues the life of the software as per
the changing needs of the user from time to time. The project is no doubt has been
developed keeping in mind easy modification and enhancement that may be required from
time to time . However, there are many scopes to modify this software. As because due to
a shortage of time, we here become unable to include many things. We are trying to add the
customized searching option for the customer, dynamic payment system, book request
option, order confirmation message, etc. Due to lake of time, we here include none of them
, and in a future scope, one can develop these returns which are so essential. Only with a
little more doing it is possible to design the formats for those options. Moreover, an online system will be more helpful to the organization. . With almost the same data with only
a little modification, an online system can be designed to fulfill their demands. All these
can be considered to be the future scope of this project.

# CONCLUSION
After implementing the application it will contain the advantages that are
incomparable to the present contemporary systems used by the customer. The most
admirable feature found was its simplicity in terms of application to the user but
its highly beneficial outputs can't be ignored. The users will be highly benefited
after using the system.It is hoped that this project will help future developers
to modify and implement the system. After modifying some techniques of the
programs, it will give us the best performance as our requirements. The project will
be very useful for the users.
